              <p>Idaho is a mountainous state in the northwest United States with large swaths of preserved 
              wilderness and outdoor recreation areas. Boise, Idaho's capital, is nestled in the foothills 
              of the Rocky Mountains and is separated by the Boise River, which is famous for rafting and 
              fishing. Julia Davis Park, on the city's riverfront, is a downtown green space with a rose 
              garden, museums, and a zoo. <br> <br>

              
              Come and have fun, sledding, climbing snowy mountains, excursions, ice skating and of course enjoying the resort 
              or the small towns around with its variety of B & B.</p>
